        <h2>Problem statement: Too Many Apps</h2>
        <p>
          There are too many apps for on-campus information, as well as no good apps for finding information solely on the website.

        <p>
            The affinity diagram is split into five columns/groups: Design, Functionality, Business, Getting Info, and Advertising. The Design column notes that the app should be customizatable and easy to navigate. The Functionality group gives examples of what the app should do, such as import all other campus apps and have a reliable campus map. The Business cluster focuses on the cost to create the app and if it would require starting a business to run. The Getting Info column asks how to redirect the information from the college's website and apps to a single source. The Advertising group brings up how to get the college(s) to use the app.
